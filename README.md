react-mosaic-app
==========

This React project is bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

# Motivation

In this coding exercise, I am planning to make an image mosaic creator.

# Sample Output

Here is a sample from the app.

![Output](./docs/image2.jpeg "Output Image")

As of this time, the images used for mosaic are located in `public` folder.
In the future, it will be better to let user select these images themselves.

The quality of the mosaic is determined by several factors: the size of blocks, the grayscale function optimization.

It is also probably better to not set image for white and black. Or determine which color is the dominant background.

# Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/supershaneski/react-mosaic-app.git myproject

$ cd myproject

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Your browser will open to `http://localhost:3005/` or some other port depending on the availability.
