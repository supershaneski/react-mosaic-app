react-mosaic-app
==========

This React project is bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

# Motivation

In this coding exercise, I am planning to make an image mosaic creator.

# Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/supershaneski/react-mosaic-app.git myproject

$ cd myproject

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Your browser will open to `http://localhost:3005/` or some other port depending on the availability.
